🚀 My Project

This project is built using Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui.
I’ve set it up so it's easy to edit, run, and deploy, whether I’m using an IDE or a cloud workspace.

🛠️ How I Work on This Project
Editing with the AI Builder

I can generate components, update UI, and make changes using prompts.
All updates are automatically committed to the project repository.

Editing Locally (VS Code or Any IDE)

To work locally:

# Clone the repository
git clone <REPO_URL>

# Move into the project directory
cd <PROJECT_NAME>

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev


Once the server is running, I can edit files freely with instant hot reload.

Editing Directly in GitHub

For quick fixes, I can open a file, click the edit button, make changes, and commit them directly.

Using GitHub Codespaces

If I want a cloud-based development environment, I can launch a Codespace and work just like in local VS Code.
